For the longest time I've used the "dai<sub>113</sub>" logo, though I have done multiple iterations on it.

<div align="center">

</div>

As you can see, the general idea of it has been the same ever since I started using it. It was the first logo I could think of, and I couldn't be bothered thinking of a new one. But now, I think it's time for a change. I've entered a new chapter of my life, and I think it's time for a new logo to represent that.

I wanted to make a logomark to optimize my branding for a while now, because my previous logos as favicons, for example, were way too complex to be
used in such small sizes.

Since the beginning of 2024, I've been wondering "How can I represent myself?", because "daimond113" isn't something
I can turn into a logomark. Just putting a diamond would be too generic. Then I remembered the star I'd been using instead of the dot in the letter
"i" in my name.

This star comes from the fact that I've always loved astronomy, and I've always been fascinated by the facts of our universe. You can see this
from the fact my website has had moving stars in the background a few iterations, including the current one.

## The new logo

My new logo is a purple star and a smaller one in its centre, simulating a shining star. I also created a logotype to go with it, which is just the logomark and "daimond113" in DM Sans (which is also used on this website). And to top it off I created a monochrome version of the logo, which makes both stars visible.

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; gap: 2rem; width: 100%;">

<div style="width: 250px" title="new logomark">
import logoSvg from '/logo.svg?raw';

<Fragment set:html={logoSvg} />
</div>

<div style="width: 250px" title="new logotype">
import logotypeSvg from '/logotype.svg?raw';

<Fragment set:html={logotypeSvg.replaceAll('fill="#DBADFF"', 'fill="currentColor"')} />
</div>

<div style="width: 250px" title="monochrome logo">
import monochromeSvg from '/logo-monochrome.svg?raw';

<Fragment set:html={monochromeSvg} />
</div>

</div>

This logo has much more colour, and overall feels less empty. I feel like this logo represents me better than any other logo I've ever had. It just feels right. I hope you like it as much as I do, and I
look forward to posting more content with this new logo.
