So, I rewrote biasdo.

biasdo is my chat app, which I wanted to write for a few years, but previously haven't had the knowledge to do so properly.

## Pre-rewrite

### Frontend

I've tried using NextJS, Remix, and even SolidStart, but none of them worked out for me. This caused me severe burn-out, and I stopped working on biasdo for a few months.
Then one day I watched a video about Svelte, which motivated me to try SvelteKit. This was
the framework that worked, unlike the previous ones [mainly due to my lack of previous knowledge](#server-side-rendering-of-the-frontend).

### Backend

First I tried using Firebase, but it didn't work [how I wanted to use it](#backend-structure), then I tried using
the frontend's server which didn't work out due to the frameworks not being meant to be used like traditional backends on the scale I wanted to use them,
and an external realtime data provider, namely Ably, but that didn't work out either.

For some reason, Ably was
quite slow for me, but I believe it was because of the way I used it, which most likely was not the intended way.
I also read about Pusher, but after reading the opinions of others it seemed that Ably was the better choice, so I went with that.
I would've tried Pusher after seeing that Ably didn't work out, but I was just too exhausted to try another service, which is why
the backend uses its own WebSocket server.

## Stack choice

After all my attempts, I landed on a combination of SvelteKit and actix-web. This turned out to be the stack that worked best for me.
I like how Svelte works, and actix-web is a really fast and reliable web framework for Rust (though the middleware system can be a pain).

When I first got a basic version of biasdo working, I was really happy with the result, and published it on the web.
Unfortunately, this version only contained basic functionality, so no updating of data, no data deletion, and only a basic authentication system.
This is why I decided to rewrite it again, now with the knowledge I gained from making the first actually _usable_ version.

### Backend structure

The usage of the backend is quite simple:

1. The frontend connects to the WebSocket server
2. The frontend sends an HTTP request to the backend to get the initial data it needs
3. The WebSocket server sends updates to the frontend

This structure allows for the frontend to be updated with new data in real-time, without the need to poll the backend for new data.

Before the rewrite steps 1 and 2 were executed at the same time, which caused [issues](#data-loading).

## Rewrite

The rewrite allowed me to make the user interface cleaner, and for the backend having recently made another actix-web backend (for [pesde](https://pesde.daimond113.com))
during which creation I learned a lot about actix-web, I was able to make the backend much cleaner and use better practices as well.

Overall, I managed to cross some things off my TODO list:

- Implement [OAuth](#oauth)
- Implement data updating and deletion
- Improve the user interface
- Add rate limiting
- Add a friend system

### Issues spotted during the rewrite

#### Data loading

Because of data updating and deletion, I noticed an issue with how the stores of data were populated. It had to do with me using [loader functions](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load) to populate the stores,
which caused the stores to be repopulated with old data on every page navigation. This was fixed by using the `onMount` function to fetch & populate the stores,
it's the reason the frontend now displays loading spinners when navigating between pages.

Pre-rewrite biasdo had a possible race condition (which I hadn't spotted due to the lack of data updates) where the WebSocket would connect
_after_ the data was loaded, which would cause the data to be outdated. An example of this issue:

1. The user navigates to a channel page
2. The user fetches the messages in this channel
3. Some other user sends a message to this channel
4. Only now the WebSocket connects, and the message is not received

This was fixed by connecting the WebSocket and [only then fetching the data](https://github.com/daimond113/biasdo/blob/961a69de5ca631c53eabca7cc697fa48e79dc6b3/packages/client/src/lib/stores.ts#L535-L537).

#### Storing data

I previously stored the data by using an array of objects, which was not the best way to store this kind of data, especially since it has unique identifiers.
There was also an uncommon, yet possible issue where the binary search used to find the data would not find the data, which then errored because virtual lists used
to render messages and members need a unique key for each item.

Having learned what a BTreeMap is from using Rust, I decided to use that structure to store the data, which allowed me to easily update and delete data, but also to easily find data.
I decided on using a BTreeMap because when rendering the data, I want it to be sorted, and a BTreeMap is sorted by default.
I could of course use a Map and sort it when rendering, but then I'd have to sort it every time I render the data, which is not ideal.

Using a BTreeMap solved a lot of issues I had with the data, and I am happy with the choice I made.

#### Server-side rendering of the frontend

I noticed a lot of the issues I had were caused by the frontend being rendered on the server because of the WebSocket connection,
which I'd have trouble connecting to reliably because of the server-side rendering. Fixing this would've required
using 2 connections (one for the server and one for the client), but that would lead to [issues](#data-loading) with the data loading.

I fixed this by adding `export const ssr = false` in the `+layout.ts` file, however I did not look deeper into why that was until when I began the rewrite.
This turned out to be why the other frameworks didn't work out for me.
Despite this, I am happy with SvelteKit the most out of all the frameworks I've tried, so I am happy with the choice I made.

### OAuth

When looking at implementing OAuth2 I also noticed the in-progress specification for OAuth2.1, which I decided to implement instead of OAuth2.
It's mainly backwards-compatible, but some deprecated features have been removed (implicit grant for example). To not overcomplicate the backend
with features which I'd have to remove later, I decided to implement OAuth2.1 from the start, despite it not being finalized yet.

I also decided to not use a crate for OAuth and instead implement it on my own, which allowed me to learn a lot about OAuth and how it works.
Most likely I have made some mistakes, but if I spot them, I'll fix them.

## Next steps

The next steps are:

- Implementing attachments and icons (for users, servers, and OAuth clients)
- Implementing WebAuthn for user authentication (and therefore allowing passwordless logins with a security key)
- Implementing voice/video chatting (using WebRTC)
- Adding a blocking system
- Creating a server permissions system
- And possibly implementing user-configurable themes (though I am not sure about this one yet)

Working on the rewrite was unfortunately a very exhausting process, but I am happy with the result. I will most likely
be taking a longer break from working on biasdo, but I am looking forward to working on it again in the future.
